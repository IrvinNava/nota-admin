Nielsen’s Women Business Resource Group, Women in Nielsen (WIN), first began working with Ingrid in early 2021. Many of our representatives attended her galvanizing event, the Women’s Ambassador Forum in Spring of 2021. This forum served as a model and inspiration for our own leadership summit, which we held in September 2021. The WIN BRG and Nielsen have continued to work with Ingrid, supporting such initiatives as “Coding for a Change”, not only because we believe in Ingrid’s mission but because she is an inspiration to each and every one of us. She brings light to every project and hope to every story.</div>
